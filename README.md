I decided to impetment a recipe tagging system as well as a seasonal collection rotation. I also added validation to make sure items had no empty spaces or incorrect values.  To be honest, I'm not very proud of this code. I had to look up a lot of how to write it online, since I'm uncomfortable with databases.
